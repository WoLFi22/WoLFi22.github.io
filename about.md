Hey, I'm Lea, and my research focuses on the classification of German dialects using audio recordings. I'm currently pursuing my PhD at the [_Research Center Deutscher Sprachatlas_](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb09/dsa) (DSA) at Philipps-Universität Marburg, under the supervision of [Lucie Flek](https://www.uni-bonn.de/de/forschung-lehre/forschungsprofil/transdisziplinaere-forschungsbereiche/tra1/mitgliederverzeichnis/lucie-flek) and [Alfred Lameli](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/fb09/dsa/einrichtung/personen/lameli/start-99). I'm employed in the [_Regionalsprache.de_](https://regionalsprache.de/en/home.aspx) project, which is a long-term project funded by the Academy of Sciences and Literature in Mainz and also contribute to the BMBF project [_AnDy_](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb09/dsa/projects/current-projects/andy). During my time at the DSA, I have worked on system development and contributed to various projects, including the creation of the [_Hessenplattform_](https://dsa.info/hessen/).

Since January 2021, I've been working at the DSA. I started as a student assistant and now continue as a PhD candidate. During the time as student assistant, I developed the second version of the app [_Welcome to Bavaria_](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/fb09/dsa/projekte/abgeschlossene-projekte/app-welcome-to-bavaria-1/app-welcome-to-bavaria) on my own. The first version was developed as part of a Master's project in a team of students. Additionally, I have experience as a tutor at Philipps-Universität Marburg, where I taught programming, technical informatics, and database systems.

I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Informatics at Philipps-Universität Marburg. My Bachelor's thesis focused on "Effiziente Serialisierung von Objekten" (Efficient Serialization of Objects). For my Master's thesis, I worked on "Angewandter Learning Analytics Prozess auf Basis einer Sprachlern-App" (Applied Learning Analytics Process Based on a Language Learning App), which was built upon the Android app that I helped develop.

# Research Interests

<!--
My research is organized into three main areas of focus:

1. **Horizontal Dialect Classification Using Deep Learning**  
   *How can deep learning techniques be optimized to improve the classification of German dialects based on audio recordings?*

   - **Insights from Misclassified Segments:**  
     What insights can be gained by comparing the properties of misclassified segments with the overall dataset properties?

   - **Data Augmentation:**  
     How does data augmentation affect dialect classification model performance, and what are the optimal strategies for balancing augmentation with original data, particularly regarding the types of augmentation used, its impact on rare speakers and dialects, and the potential shift in model focus from speaker recognition to dialect differentiation?

2. **Horizontal Dialect Classification Using Phonetic Features**  
   *Which phonetic features are most effective in distinguishing between dialects, and how can they be integrated with deep learning models?*

   - **Vowel Contributions:**  
     How much information do vowels alone contribute to dialect classification compared to full audio segments?

   - **Phonetic Feature Extraction:**  
     What are the most relevant phonetic features for distinguishing dialects, and how can they be extracted?

3. **Combined Approaches for Vertical Dialect Classification**  
   *Can insights from deep learning and phonetic feature analysis be used to construct an enhanced dialect classification model for horizontal classification?*

   - **Dialect Switching Analysis:**  
     How can the analysis of individual speaking behavior and dialectal variation within specific segments reveal whether a speaker is a dialect switcher, shifter, or remains consistent, and what factors, such as social environment, audience, and conversational context, influence these dialectal changes?

- **Deep Learning for Horizontal Dialect Classification**<br>
How can deep learning techniques be optimized to enhance the classification of German dialects from audio recordings? Key aspects include leveraging insights from misclassified segments and optimizing data augmentation strategies for dialect differentiation.

- **Phonetic Features in Horizontal Dialect Classification**<br>
Which phonetic features are crucial for distinguishing between dialects, and how can they be effectively integrated with deep learning models? This includes evaluating the contribution of vowels and extracting relevant phonetic features.

- **Combined Approaches for Enhanced Vertical Dialect Classification**<br>
How can insights from both deep learning and phonetic feature analysis be used to develop a more effective horizontal dialect classification model? This involves analyzing speaking behavior to understand code-switching and the impact of social and contextual factors on dialect variation.
